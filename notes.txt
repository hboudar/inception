docker      :   is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy application quickly
                using containers

container   :   is a lightweitght, portable, and self-sufficient unit that packages an application
                along with its dependencies, libraries, and runtime environment.

docker engine : is the core technology behind building, shipping and running containerized applications.
                (REST API, CLI, Daemon)
            
    *Docker Daemon : (runs in the backround) manages images, containers, network, etc...
    *Docker CLI(docker) : the command-line tool used to talk with the Daemon
    *Docker REST API : how the cli and other tools talk to the Daemon

image : are read-only


docker ps -a(all)
docker images | listing images

docker build -t(for naming) --build-arg name=value .
docker run -p(publish port) [--env-file filename or --env name=value] -d(detach)  i(interactive) t(tty) --rm(auto removed after exit) --name(for naming) -v(bind-mount a volume | name:/path)
docker start -a(attach) -i(interactive)

docker stop (id)
docker rm (id)
docker rmi (id)
docker volume rm (id)

docker image  | managing images
docker volume | managing volumes

docker network

docker cp
docker push
docker pull
docker tag


docker attach
docker logs (id) | Fetch the logs of a container


instead of full path : $(pwd) | -v $(pwd):/app:ro | ro(read only)


---------for networking-------
1-request from container to www : done without any problem
2-request from container to host machine : done but Use host.docker.internal as address
3-request from container to other container : done but requires a container network
