docker      :   is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy application quickly
                using containers

container   :   is a lightweitght, portable, and self-sufficient unit that packages an application
                along with its dependencies, libraries, and runtime environment.

docker engine : is the core technology behind building, shipping and running containerized applications.
                (REST API, CLI, Daemon)
            
    *Docker Daemon : (runs in the backround) manages images, containers, network, etc...
    *Docker CLI(docker) : the command-line tool used to talk with the Daemon
    *Docker REST API : how the cli and other tools talk to the Daemon

image : are read-only
